## Hodoor

## üìå Project Description

**Hudoorr** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline student attendance management in educational institutions. It serves three main user roles:

üßë‚Äçüéì **Students**: Can view their attendance history and receive notifications when marked absent.

üßë‚Äçüè´ **Teachers**: Can view attendance reports and access saved records.

üõÇ **Attendance Officers**: Responsible for recording daily attendance, sending absence notifications, and exporting reports.

The frontend is built with React.js, using JWT authentication to handle secure logins and protected routes. It communicates with a Django REST Framework backend, and the entire app is Dockerized for smooth deployment and scalability.
