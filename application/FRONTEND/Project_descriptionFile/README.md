## Hodoor

## 📌 Project Description

**Hudoorr** is a full-stack web application designed to streamline student attendance management in educational institutions. It serves three main user roles:

🧑‍🎓 **Students**: Can view their attendance history and receive notifications when marked absent.

🧑‍🏫 **Teachers**: Can view attendance reports and access saved records.

🛂 **Attendance Officers**: Responsible for recording daily attendance, sending absence notifications, and exporting reports.

The frontend is built with React.js, using JWT authentication to handle secure logins and protected routes. It communicates with a Django REST Framework backend, and the entire app is Dockerized for smooth deployment and scalability.
